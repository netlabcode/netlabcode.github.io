abstract: "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source, vendor-agnostic framework introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 that standardizes how large language models (LLMs) integrate with external tools, data sources, and services. Acting as a universal interface—often likened to a USB-C port for AI—MCP enables developers to build AI applications without gluing together numerous custom integrations, thereby solving the pervasive “N×M” connector problem. With client–server architecture, rich SDK support across languages, and growing adoption by major AI platforms, MCP is poised to become the backbone of scalable, interoperable AI systems. This research will analyze MCP’s architecture, evaluate its effectiveness in facilitating multi-tool LLM workflows, and explore security and usability limitations to support its evolution as a reliable standard in AI integration."

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source, vendor-agnostic framework introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 that standardizes how large language models (LLMs) integrate with external tools, data sources, and services. Acting as a universal interface—often likened to a USB-C port for AI—MCP enables developers to build AI applications without gluing together numerous custom integrations, thereby solving the pervasive “N×M” connector problem. With client–server architecture, rich SDK support across languages, and growing adoption by major AI platforms, MCP is poised to become the backbone of scalable, interoperable AI systems. This research will analyze MCP’s architecture, evaluate its effectiveness in facilitating multi-tool LLM workflows, and explore security and usability limitations to support its evolution as a reliable standard in AI integration.
