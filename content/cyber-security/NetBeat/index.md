The NetBeat aims to employ anomaly detection approach grounded in network traffic characterization. The concept is inspired by the human heartbeat, where rhythm and pattern can reveal the anomaly.

### NetBeat: Network Traffic Characterization for Adaptive Anomaly Detection.

Signature-based solutions and AI-driven supervised classification methods for anomaly detection often fail to keep pace with evolving cyberattacks because of the non-deterministic nature. The NetBeat aims to employ anomaly detection approach grounded in network traffic characterization. The concept is inspired by the human heartbeat, where rhythm and pattern can reveal the anomaly. NetBeat applies this analogy to network communications by modeling baseline traffic patterns and detecting deviations in real time. The proposed method aims to improve adaptability and resilience against unpredictable and emerging threats.
