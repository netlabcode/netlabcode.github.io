### Modelling Cyber-Physical System Digital Twin

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) require integrated modeling of both operational technology and physical infrastructure to enable accurate monitoring, analysis, and control. This research proposes the development of a CPS Digital Twin that combines network and power system simulation within a unified framework. Mininet will be employed to emulate the operational technology layer, capturing communication patterns, latency, and network topology effects. PandaPower will be used to simulate the electrical power system, enabling detailed modeling of grid components, load flows, and operational states. The cyber and physical domains will be interconnected through the OPC UA protocol, facilitating standardized, secure, and real-time data exchange between simulators. This digital twin framework will support the study of CPS resilience, performance optimization, and the impact of cyber events on physical operations, providing a valuable platform for testing, training, and research in secure, intelligent infrastructure systems.
