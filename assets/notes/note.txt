NetBeat: Netwok Traffic Characterization

Signature based solution and AI-based supervised classification for anomaly detection unable to deal with evolving cyber attack due to non deterministic characteristic.
Therefore, this research aims to unveil anomaly detection method based on the network traffic characteristic.
NetBeat inspired from a heart beat, where the objective aims to understand network pattern like a heartbeat in human body in the context of network communication.
